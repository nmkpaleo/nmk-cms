# Optional tooth-marking ML inference dependencies (CPU-only)
# Keeps production install lean and avoids CUDA/GPU wheels.
# TM-001 feasibility status (Python 3.10 runtime):
# - Candidate upgrade pair validated for availability on public package index:
#   torch==2.8.0, torchvision==0.23.0
# - Decision: HOLD dependency pin upgrade in this file until CI/build runners can
#   successfully resolve +cpu wheels from download.pytorch.org.
# - A Docker validation target (`torch-cpu-compat-check`) now exists to verify
#   torch>=2.8.0+cpu compatibility in environments with CPU index access.
