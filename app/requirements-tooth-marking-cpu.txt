# Optional tooth-marking ML inference dependencies (CPU-only)
# Keeps production install lean and avoids CUDA/GPU wheels.
#
# TM-002 decision:
# - Runtime pins are intentionally retained because TM-001 feasibility validation
#   could not complete against https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu in this
#   environment (network/proxy restriction).
# - Upgrade to torch>=2.8.0+cpu is deferred until CI/build runners can resolve
#   both torch and torchvision +cpu wheels successfully.
