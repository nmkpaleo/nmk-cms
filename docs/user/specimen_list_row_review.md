# Specimen List Row Review

## Overview
Row review is the step where extracted specimen list rows are checked and corrected before accession creation. Reviewers can edit row JSON, approve good rows, or reject unusable candidates.

## What You Can Do
- **Approve** rows that look correct.
- **Reject** rows with missing or unusable data.
- **Edit** row JSON when the extracted values need adjustments.

## Review Tips
- Confirm that accession numbers are present and correctly transcribed.
- Check that ditto marks have been expanded into full values.
- Use the confidence score as a guide, but always verify by eye.
