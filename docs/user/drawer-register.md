# Drawer Register (User)

Collection Managers can track scanning of drawers and document folders.

## Accessing the Drawer Register
1. Log in to the CMS.
2. Use the navigation menu to open **Drawer Register**.

## Creating a Drawer
1. Click **New Drawer** on the list page.
2. Enter the code, description and optional locality or taxon links.
3. Set an estimated number of documents.
4. Choose the current scanning status. If it is *In progress*, select the users who are scanning.
5. Save the drawer.

## Selecting Multiple Localities, Taxa, and Users
- Use the Ctrl (or Cmd on macOS) key while clicking to select more than one locality, taxon, or scanning user.
- The selections can be adjusted later by reopening the drawer for editing.

## Updating or Reviewing
- Select a drawer code to view details and the change log.
- Review the **Localities** and **Taxa** cards to confirm the drawer's related records. Each card lists all linked entries and displays an accessible empty state when nothing is attached.
- Use the edit icon to update a drawer. Status and user updates are recorded automatically, and the Localities and Taxa selections remain available for adjustment.
