# Scan Uploads (User)

Collection Managers can submit scanned images for processing.

## Uploading Scans
1. Sign in to the Django admin site.
2. Click **Upload scans** in the header.
3. Choose one or more files named `YYYY-MM-DD(n).png`.
4. Submit the form to validate the files and queue them for processing.

The system moves valid files to the pending folder and creates matching Media records.
