# Specimen List Review Queue

## Overview
Use the specimen list review queue to claim pages from uploaded PDFs, review the page image, and mark the page as approved or rejected. The queue helps prevent review collisions by locking pages to a reviewer for a limited time.

## How to review pages
1. Open the review queue and filter by status, source label, or assigned reviewer.
2. Select **Review** for a page to claim the lock.
3. Review the page image and choose **Approve** or **Reject**.
4. If you need to stop reviewing, select **Release lock** so another reviewer can take over.

## Lock behavior
- Locks prevent multiple reviewers from editing the same page at the same time.
- If a lock expires, another reviewer can reload the page and take ownership.
- Releasing the lock returns the page to the pending queue.
