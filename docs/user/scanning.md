# Scanning

The scanning workflow links assigned drawers to timed scanning sessions so that managers and interns can coordinate digitization work.

## Roles and access

### Collection Managers
- Maintain drawer records and choose the correct scanning status for each drawer. When a drawer is set to *In progress*, managers must select the interns who will scan it.
- Review drawer details to monitor the log of every scanning session and confirm when work is finished.

### Interns
- See a **My Drawers** table on the dashboard listing only drawers that are marked *In progress* and assigned to them, including any active timer for work already underway.
- Start and stop scanning sessions from the dashboard buttons. The **Start scanning task** button is disabled whenever a session is already running, and the **Stop scanning task** button is disabled until a session has begun.

## Preparing a drawer for scanning (Collection Managers)
1. Open the Drawer Register and create or edit the drawer that needs to be scanned.
2. Change the scanning status to *In progress* and select one or more interns in the **Scanning users** field. Save the drawer to publish the assignment.
3. Update the status to *Scanned* once the scans have been reviewed so the drawer no longer appears in intern dashboards.

## Running a scanning session (Interns)
1. Sign in and open the dashboard. The **My Drawers** table shows every drawer you have been assigned that is currently in progress.
2. Click **Start scanning task** when you begin scanning. The system records the start time and displays a live timer while the session is active.
3. Click **Stop scanning task** as soon as you finish with the drawer. The timer stops and the end time is saved to the scan log for managers to review.
4. If further work is needed later, repeat the start/stop process. Each pair of actions creates a new entry in the drawerâ€™s scan history, ensuring the project tracks how long each session lasted.

## Monitoring progress (Collection Managers)
- Use the drawer detail page to review who scanned the drawer and how long each session lasted before approving the work or updating the status.
- Adjust assignments or statuses as needed so that only active tasks remain visible to interns on the dashboard.
