# Review Queue

## Overview
The review queue lists specimen list pages that are ready for human review. Reviewers open a page from the queue to claim it for review, which prevents multiple reviewers from editing the same page at the same time.

## How to review a page
1. Open the review queue from the navigation.
2. Select a page to open the review screen.
3. The system assigns the page to you while it is open for review.
4. Complete the review actions (release, approve, or reject) as needed.

## Locking behavior
- Only one reviewer can hold a page at a time.
- Locks expire after a configured timeout so another reviewer can take over if needed.
- Administrators can reassign or release locks when required.
