# Localities (User)

Collection managers can review and update locality information within the CMS.

## Accessing Localities
1. Log in to the CMS.
2. Use the navigation menu to open **Localities**.

## Filtering and Reviewing
- Use the filter panel to search by abbreviation, name, or geological time. Geological time filtering accepts either the abbreviations (`M`, `Pi`, `Pe`, `H`) or the full names when typing into the multi-select widget.
- The locality list shows geological time names joined with `/` alongside the number of linked accessions.
- Click a locality abbreviation to open the detail page. The **Locality overview** card displays the selected geological time names with abbreviations provided in the tooltip.
- Select **Print** to open a printable summary. The printout lists localities alphabetically in two columns (`LOCALITY`, `ABR.`, `AGE`) and finishes with an abbreviation legend.

## Editing a Locality
- Select the edit icon on a locality to update the abbreviation, name, or geological time values.
- Save your changes. New localities must be added by an administrator.
