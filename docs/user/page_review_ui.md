# Page Review UI

## Overview
The page review screen is a single-page workspace for reviewing specimen list pages. The left panel shows the page image, while the right panel provides an editable table of extracted rows.

## How to review
1. Open a page from the review queue.
2. Use the zoom control to inspect the image.
3. Edit, add, or delete rows in the extracted table as needed.
4. Save drafts during review and finish with approve or reject actions.

## Confidence highlighting
Rows with low confidence are highlighted to draw attention. You can filter the table to show only low-confidence rows.

## Not a specimen list
If a page is not a specimen list, use the “Not a specimen list” action to mark it appropriately.
