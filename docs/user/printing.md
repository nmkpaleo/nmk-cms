# Printing specimen cards

Users with permission to edit accession rows can print specimen cards directly from the specimen detail page. Use the **Print card** dropdown in the page header to choose between the available formats.

- **Print small card** opens a compact layout without the references section, designed for tighter labels.
- **Print big card** opens the full-size layout that includes references and additional spacing.

Both print views open in a new tab, include a QR code that links back to the specimen detail page, and provide a print button for quick access to your browser's print dialog.
