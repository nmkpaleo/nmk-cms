# üß≠ Codex Prompt ‚Äî Django Feature Planner

You are a **senior Django engineer and project planner**.

---

## üéØ Goal
- I will describe a feature.
- You will produce a concise, implementation-ready plan and a task breakdown.
- **Do NOT write any production code yet.**

You are responsible for **technical feasibility, maintainability, and adherence to Django best practices.**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Codebase Context
- **Python:** 3.10 (slim base image)
- **Django:** [4.2]
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Auth:** django-allauth (email + social?)
- **Auditing/versioning:** django-simple-history
- **Filtering/search:** django-filter (+ QuerySet + pagination)
- **Templates:** Django templates extending `base_generic.html`
  - HTML5 boilerplate (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html lang="en">`, `<meta charset="utf-8">`, `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`)
  - Semantic layout structure with `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
  - Global assets loaded in the `<head>` (W3.CSS CDN, Font Awesome 6 CDN, shared JS)
- **Styling:** W3.CSS (mobile-first) with minimal custom overrides in `static/css/custom.css`
- **Static/media:** [STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_ROOT], served via **nginx (production)**
- **App layout:** `/project/`, `/apps/<app_name>/`, `/templates/`, `/static/`
- **i18n/l10n:** [languages], time zone, gettext usage
- **Testing:** pytest + pytest-django (or unittest), coverage ‚â• 90%
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (tests, migrations check, flake8/ruff, mypy, docs build), Docker (optional)
- **Docs:** GitHub repo `/docs/` (MkDocs). We maintain:
  - `/docs/user/**` ‚Äî end-user docs
  - `/docs/admin/**` ‚Äî site admin docs
  - `/docs/dev/**` ‚Äî developer docs
  - `CHANGELOG.md` and ADRs in `/docs/adr/**`
- **Responsive & a11y:** Design mobile-first (W3.CSS breakpoints) with WCAG AA contrast, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation
- **Coding standards:** ruff/flake8, black, isort, pre-commit
- **Security:** django-secure defaults (SECURE_*), CSP (if applicable)
- **Dependency management:** All dependencies are tracked in `requirements.txt`.
  - Only suggest new Django/Python packages if the feature explicitly requires them, with justification.
  - Reuse existing dependencies whenever possible.
- **Configuration:** 12-factor app style (environment variables for secrets and URLs)

## üß© Feature Request (from me)

    <<<
    [Describe what you want the feature to do; user stories; data model needs; permissions; edge cases; performance; accessibility; mobile-first/W3.CSS expectations; FA icon usage; SEO; i18n; any external APIs; acceptance examples]
    >>>

---

## üì¶ Deliverables (in this exact order)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Assumptions & Scope
- Bullet list of Django-specific assumptions.
- Mention which apps will be modified or created.
- Identify reused vs. new models/forms/views.
- List required packages (if any) and justification.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ High-Level Plan
Provide 5‚Äì12 implementation steps covering:

- Models and migrations
- URLs, CBVs or APIs
- Forms/serializers
- Templates (extend `base_generic.html`, use semantic HTML5 structure, mobile-first W3.CSS, Font Awesome icons)
- Filters and pagination
- Permissions and auth integration
- Admin registration (list_display/search/filter)
- History tracking (django-simple-history)
- Tests (unit + integration)
- Docs and changelog updates
- Rollout or feature flag if relevant

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tasks (JSON)
Provide a **machine-readable JSON array** of tasks using this schema (indentation shows structure):

    [
      {
        "id": "T1",
        "title": "Short title",
        "summary": "What will be implemented",
        "app": "apps.<app_name>",
        "files_touched": [
          "apps/<app_name>/models.py",
          "apps/<app_name>/views.py",
          "templates/<app_name>/<view>.html",
          "docs/user/<topic>.md"
        ],
        "migrations": true,
        "settings_changes": [
          "INSTALLED_APPS+=['...']",
          "settings var changes as needed"
        ],
        "packages": [
          "django-allauth",
          "django-simple-history",
          "django-filter"
        ],
        "permissions": [

          "Django perms/groups"
        ],

          "Concrete, verifiable behaviors the reviewer can check in the UI and via tests"
        ],
        "test_plan": [
          "pytest unit tests for models/forms/views",
          "integration tests for URLs + templates (ensure semantic HTML5 regions, base template inheritance)",

          "filtering works via query params",
          "mobile-first layout renders with W3.CSS classes",
          "a11y smoke checks (labels/contrast/keyboard nav)"
        ],
        "docs_touched": [
          "docs/user/<page>.md",
          "docs/admin/<page>.md",
          "docs/dev/<page>.md",
          "CHANGELOG.md"

        "dependencies": [
          "T0 (design/IA)",
          "external API X"

        "risk_level": "low|med|high",
        "priority": "low|medium|high",
        "reviewer_notes": []
      }
    ]

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Risks & Mitigations

- Include rollback strategies for migrations.
- Mention accessibility (a11y), localization (i18n), and dependency vulnerabilities.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Out-of-Scope

- Include any deferred integrations or admin/UI polish not part of the MVP.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Definition of Done ‚úÖ

## üß† Rules
- Be practical and specific to Django and the listed packages.
- Prefer class-based views and built-in generic patterns.
- Modify existing apps when possible; only add new apps if justified.
- Reuse existing dependencies before adding new ones.
- Avoid verbose internal reasoning; produce concise, review-ready outputs only.
- STOP after planning. Wait for explicit approval before coding.
