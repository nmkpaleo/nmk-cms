# CMS Frontend Guidelines

_Last updated: 2025-10-24_

## Overview
The CMS frontend now relies almost entirely on W3.CSS utilities and semantic HTML5 landmarks. Every template extends `base_generic.html`, which loads the W3 stylesheet from the CDN, shared Font Awesome assets, and the small custom override bundle in `app/cms/static/css/style.css`. This document captures the patterns that must be preserved when building or updating templates.

| View Type | Primary Templates | W3.CSS Usage | Local CSS / JS Touchpoints | Notes for Refactor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| List & Search | `cms/*_list.html` variants (accession, drawer, fieldslip, locality, place, preparation, reference, storage) | Shared header rows, filter accordions, and table shells lean on `w3-container`, `w3-row-padding`, `w3-table-all`, and `w3-responsive`.【F:app/cms/templates/cms/accession_list.html†L8-L108】【F:app/cms/templates/cms/reference_list.html†L8-L123】 | Each template embeds a small `toggleAccordion` helper and duplicates the accordion markup; no bespoke CSS classes beyond inherited typography utilities.【F:app/cms/templates/cms/accession_list.html†L24-L109】 | Extract accordion into an include and switch to a shared stimulus/alpine controller to avoid per-template JS duplication. |
| Detail | `cms/*_detail.html` (accession, accession_row, drawerregister, fieldslip, locality, place, preparation, reference, storage) | Cards, summary grids, and related tables now standardise on `<main>/<section>` landmarks, `w3-card`, and Font Awesome section icons for quick scanning.【F:app/cms/templates/cms/accession_detail.html†L1-L135】【F:app/cms/templates/cms/preparation_detail.html†L1-L221】 | History tables and related lists share the same W3 table shell; no bespoke CSS classes remain. | Future enhancements: extract history table rows into a shared include and align curator action buttons with a button helper. |
| Detail + Sub-list | `cms/locality_detail.html`, `cms/storage_detail.html` | Combine W3 cards for the primary object with responsive related-object tables and Font Awesome headings.【F:app/cms/templates/cms/locality_detail.html†L1-L107】 | Manual pagination components mirror the helper used in list templates and rely solely on W3 bar/button classes.【F:app/cms/templates/cms/storage_detail.html†L108-L147】 | Align pagination markup with a single include referenced by both list and detail pages to reduce drift. |
| Dashboard | `cms/dashboard.html`, `cms/qc/dashboard_queue.html` | Role cards now share W3 card wrappers, Font Awesome section icons, and responsive tables with semantic `<section>` landmarks.【F:app/cms/templates/cms/dashboard.html†L1-L240】【F:app/cms/templates/cms/qc/dashboard_queue.html†L1-L74】 | Queue partial still expects context dicts and renders CTA buttons; empty states reuse W3 alert panels. | Future enhancements: extract repeated role-card scaffolding into an include and expose queue metadata via dataclasses to trim template logic. |
| Forms & Wizards | `cms/*_form.html`, `cms/*_wizard*.html`, `cms/add_accession_*` | All forms funnel through the refactored `base_form.html` card which applies W3 classes, ARIA labels, and Font Awesome submit icons; parent templates wrap the include in `<main>` with W3 button links.【F:app/cms/templates/includes/base_form.html†L1-L11】【F:app/cms/templates/includes/base_form_tag.html†L1-L44】【F:app/cms/templates/cms/preparation_form.html†L1-L23】 | Wizard templates continue to add per-step scripts via formset JS includes. | Keep wizard navigation consistent with the shared button styles and audit form-level accessibility when introducing new widgets. |
| History / Audit | `cms/history_table.html`, `cms/history_media_qc_table.html`, `cms/qc/history.html` | Audit tables share the `history_table` partial with `w3-table-all`, `w3-small`, `<time>` stamps, and Font Awesome action icons; the QC history page adds filter controls and pagination.【F:app/cms/templates/cms/history_table.html†L1-L69】【F:app/cms/templates/cms/qc/history.html†L1-L98】 | Detail templates include the partial directly, while the QC list view renders paginated logs via the media-specific helper. | Future enhancements: reuse the QC helper inside wizard previews once legacy CSS is retired. |
| Media / Upload | `cms/preparation_media_upload.html`, `cms/upload_media.html`, `cms/fieldslip_import.html` | All upload flows now render inside W3 cards with shared form markup; the import screen uses standard W3 inputs in place of custom drag/drop styles.【F:app/cms/templates/cms/preparation_media_upload.html†L1-L18】【F:app/cms/templates/cms/fieldslip_import.html†L1-L27】 | No bespoke CSS remains; styling relies purely on W3 utilities. | When adding new uploaders ensure `form.is_multipart` is honoured so the shared include sets `multipart/form-data` automatically. |
| Inventory | `inventory/start.html`, `inventory/session.html` | Uses `w3-row`, `w3-col`, `w3-card`, and modal helpers to present scanning workflows.【F:app/cms/templates/inventory/session.html†L1-L120】 | Custom JS drives scanning feedback and toggles classes such as `w3-pale-green`/`w3-pale-red`; no extra CSS beyond inline `<script>`. | Document which DOM hooks the JS expects before replacing custom status markup with W3 alert components. |

The matrix below expands on individual template expectations, context variables, and permission constraints prior to the W3.CSS-centric refactor.

## CSS Asset Inventory

### Local Stylesheets
| File | Path | Purpose | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CMS global styles | `app/cms/static/css/style.css` | Minimal overrides for header logo sizing, logout form alignment, Select2 width/stacking, and drag handles. | Loaded via `base_generic.html` for all CMS pages and public landing. |
| — | — | — | The merge admin and reporting UIs now rely entirely on W3.CSS utilities; dedicated stylesheets were removed in favour of shared markup classes. |

### Redundancy and Consolidation Opportunities
- **Custom CSS scope in `style.css`:** The stylesheet is limited to navigation helpers (`.logo_image`, `.logout-form`, `.sr-only`), Select2 width and stacking overrides, and the drawer drag-handle cursor. Legacy helpers such as `.template_buttons`, `.search-bar`, `.table-container`, and `.template_form_*` remain retired in favour of W3.CSS utilities.【F:app/cms/static/css/style.css†L1-L38】
- **Select2 overrides centralised:** Inline duplication was removed from `base_generic.html`; keep future adjustments inside `style.css` to avoid drift.【F:app/cms/static/css/style.css†L20-L32】【F:app/cms/templates/base_generic.html†L40-L68】
- **Template regression coverage:** Navigation (`test_navigation`), filter widgets (`test_filter_widgets`), and account entrance flows (`test_account_templates`) now assert the presence of W3 classes so future edits cannot silently reintroduce bespoke selectors. Extend this pattern when reworking other templates that lean on W3 utility classes.【F:app/cms/tests/test_navigation.py†L24-L76】【F:app/cms/tests/test_filter_widgets.py†L1-L52】【F:app/cms/tests/test_account_templates.py†L1-L23】

### Follow-up Ideas
- Centralize frequently reused filter accordion markup into an include to reduce duplication across list templates.
- Split the current monolithic `style.css` into domain-specific bundles (public landing, CMS shell, forms, import flows) to simplify future audits.
- Document the expected CSS hooks for dynamically injected components (e.g., Select2, drag handles) within this guideline to aid future refactors.

## Template guidelines

1. **Extend the base layout.** All new templates should inherit from `base_generic.html` to obtain navigation, asset loading, and the responsive grid meta tags.
2. **Use semantic regions.** Continue to wrap primary content in `<main>`, logical sections in `<section>`/`<article>`, and supporting content in `<aside>`/`<footer>`.
3. **Leverage W3 grids before custom CSS.** `w3-row-padding` and `w3-col` (or `w3-half`, `w3-third`, etc.) cover most layout needs. When the design calls for alignment tweaks, prefer W3 spacing utilities (`w3-margin`, `w3-padding`) over hand-written rules.
4. **Buttons and links.** Use `w3-button` combined with palette classes (`w3-theme`, `w3-teal`, `w3-white`, `w3-border`) for all calls to action. Rounded buttons should add `w3-round` or `w3-round-large` instead of bespoke border radii.
5. **Forms.** Django form widgets should receive W3 classes via either the shared base form include or widget `attrs`. Inputs use `w3-input`, selects use `w3-select`, and groups should sit inside `w3-section` or `w3-margin-bottom` containers. Preserve ARIA attributes and label associations provided by Django.
6. **Tables.** Data tables should combine `w3-table-all` with `w3-striped`, `w3-hoverable`, and `w3-responsive` as appropriate. Pagination controls reuse the navigation button pattern with `w3-bar` wrappers.
7. **Messages and alerts.** Use W3 panel helpers (`w3-panel`, `w3-pale-green`, `w3-border`) for flash messages, validation summaries, or background highlights.
8. **Icons.** Font Awesome 6 is available globally. Use the standard `<i class="fa-solid fa-icon">` markup and avoid inline SVG unless the icon is missing from FA.

## Custom CSS inventory
The shared stylesheet `app/cms/static/css/style.css` intentionally remains small. Only the following helpers are allowed:

- `.logo_image` – constrains the navigation logo width so it fits within the bar.
- `.logout-form` – removes default margins around the logout button’s form wrapper so it aligns with bar items.
- `.sr-only` – provides an accessible screen-reader-only helper that W3.CSS does not supply.
- `.django-select2`, `.select2-container`, `.select2-selection`, `.select2-dropdown` – ensure Select2 widgets span full width and stack above modals or dropdowns.
- `.drag-handle` – keeps the grab cursor for drag-to-reorder handles; JavaScript toggles this on drawer lists.

Do not add new selectors without first checking whether a W3 utility or an existing helper can cover the requirement. If a new override is unavoidable, document the rationale directly above the rule and update this guideline.

## JavaScript expectations
Certain scripts assume W3 classes are present:

- `static/javascript.js` toggles `w3-show` and `w3-hide` to open the mobile navigation panel.
- `static/js/merge_admin.js` generates search results using `w3-card-4`, `w3-padding`, and `w3-button` classes. Any markup changes must update both the template and script.
- Inventory scanning scripts add contextual classes such as `w3-pale-green` to status elements. Keep those hooks stable.

## Testing coverage
Template regression tests live in `app/cms/tests/` and verify that W3 classes render as expected:

- `test_navigation.py` asserts the navigation bar structure and mobile toggle behaviour.
- `test_filter_widgets.py` ensures django-filter widgets expose W3 form classes.
- `test_account_templates.py` checks the login and signup templates for the expected card and button classes.

Add similar assertions when creating new templates that depend on W3-specific structure.

## Future enhancements
- Extract the repeated filter accordion into a reusable include to reduce duplication across list templates.
- Publish example snippets for common layouts (cards, tables, modals) so contributors can copy the sanctioned markup.
- Audit remaining JavaScript-driven DOM injections to ensure they emit the same class names as the server-rendered templates.
