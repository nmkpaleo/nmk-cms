# Specimen List Row Review (Admin)

## Overview
Row review provides a staging workflow for specimen list extraction. Admins can filter rows by status, page type, or confidence and then approve, reject, or edit candidates.

## Review Workflow
1. Filter rows to the highest-priority batches.
2. Open each candidate and verify its extracted values.
3. Approve or reject, or edit the JSON payload for corrections.

## Operational Guidance
- Encourage reviewers to work on a limited batch size to avoid collisions.
- Use confidence filters to triage lower-quality extractions.
- Re-run extraction only when raw OCR is updated.
